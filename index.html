<p class="message">no. after the article you were a part of for the quest, and lack of changes even after numerous people left detailed comments describing what should be changed, you aren't fit to be a quest editor unless you do some serious soul searching. the article insinuating the protests for palestine are antisemetic is extremely disappointing. frankly,im disgusted at the neutral position the article took in covering a protest for liberation. if you think that was good journalism you should not be a journalist until you re- evaluate whether you will fight for liberation or cling to neutrality and side with opressors</p>

<p class="message">Reedies have now been made a target of zionist groups. I think its time for an apology. Someone was almost ran over by a jeep today with an Isreal flag and an American flag on the back of it. There have been many Quest apologies in my three years at Reed, and none of them have been for something this drastic. We're all waiting.</p>

<p class="message">This reddit thread has almost 200 comments, most not too different from this. @reedquest Your reporting actually has-- consequences, and you should not be surprised to have brought harm onto this campus</p>
